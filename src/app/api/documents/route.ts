This document covers fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The key topics include:

**Machine Learning Fundamentals:**
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It enables systems to automatically improve their performance through experience.

**Neural Networks:**
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and can learn complex patterns from data.

**Deep Learning:**
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, making them particularly effective for complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

**Learning Types:**
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data without specific target outputs

These concepts form the foundation of modern AI systems and are essential for understanding how intelligent systems can learn and adapt to new information.
